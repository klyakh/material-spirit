## Building

Material Spirit codebase is split into separate packages to follow the similar structure in MDC Web. Also codebase is organized into multi-package repository, called [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md), also to follow the same approach in MDC Web. [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is used to manage this.
